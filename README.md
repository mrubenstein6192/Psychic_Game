# Psychic_Game

https://mrubenstein6192.github.io/Psychic_Game/

In this game, the user tries to guess which letter the computer has randomly chosen.  

The user will have up to 10 guesses before he/she loses and has to try again.  

When a user guesses correctly, he/she receives a win and the game restarts.  

The game will record each incorrect guess so that the user does not repeat a guess.
